### Hi there 👋

#### I'm <b>Sandra</b>, a passionate learner and aspiring web developer with a background in linguistics and a love for gaming.👾

👩‍💻 I'm currently diving into the world of web development, where I'm activaly exploring various programming languages and frameworks<br>

💬 With experience as a translator, language teacher, and language data analyst, I bring a unique perspective to coding, blending my linguistic skills with the logic of programming.

🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming, traveling or trying out new recipes.

🌍 As a global citizen, I've had the chance of working and living in Vietnam, Brazil, Germany, Australia and Spain, soaking up diverse cultures and languages along the way.
